```java
class Employee {
    private int ID;
    private String name;
    private double salary;
    Employee (int ID, String name, double salary) {
        this.ID = ID;
        this.name = name;
        this.salary = salary;
    }

    public double getSalary() {
        return salary;

    public void incrementSalary(double percentage) {
        this.salary += (this.salary * percentage) / 100;
    }
}

class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Employee[] employees = {
                new Employee(1, "Mickey Mouse", 100000.0),
                new Employee(2, "Donald Duck", 200000.0),
                new Employee(3, "Goofy Goo", 300000.0)
        };

        Employee brotherBear = new Employee(4, "Brother Bear", 5000.0);
        Employee mufasa = new Employee(5, "Mufasa - The Lion King", 500000.0);
    }
}

## Java Streams Creation
**Following are some snippets to help create streams.**

#### Stream of Employees from an existing array
```java
Stream<Employee> employeeStream = Stream.of(employees);
```

#### Stream of employees from an existing list
```java
List<Employee> empList = Arrays.asList(employees);
Stream<Employee> employeeStream = empList.stream();
```

#### Stream from a list of individual Employee objects.
```java
Stream<Employee> employeeStream = Stream.of(brotherBear, mufasa);
```

#### Using Stream.Builder to build a stream of Employee objects
```java
Stream.Builder<Employee> builder = Stream.builder();

builder.accept(brotherBear);
builder.accept(mufasa);
builder.accept(new Employee(6, "SherKhan", 450000.0));

Stream<Employee> employeeStream = builder.build();
```

## Java Streams Operations
There are two types of stream operations - **intermediate** & **terminal**.

##### Terminal
> An operation that marks the stream as consumed. And ends the stream operation
>
##### Intermediate
> An operation that returns a new stream after performing the supplied operation on input stream

**Following are some snippets of available operations on Java Streams and their usages.**


#### forEach
_Operation Type: Terminal_

Loop over stream element and call the supplied function over each. `forEach()` is a terminal operation, i.e. once `forEach()`
is called, the stream is considered to be consumed.

```java
List<Employee> empList = Arrays.asList(employees);
empList.stream().forEach(e -> e.incrementSalary(10.0));
```

> **_NOTE:_**  Stream can be consumed only once. If attempted to consume after being consumed, the following exception is thrown
>
> **IllegalStateException: stream has already been operated upon or closed.**


#### map
_Operation Type: Intermediate_

`map()` applies the supplied function to each element of the current stream
and returns a new stream. The resultant stream can be of the same or different type.

```java
List<Employee> empList = Arrays.asList(employees);
List<Double> salaries = empList.stream().
        .map(Employee::getSalary).collect(Collectors.toList());
```

```java
// stream of integers returned as stream of squared versions of themselves.
Stream<Integer> squared = Stream.of(1, 2, 3, 4, 5).map(x -> x * x);
```

#### collect
_Operation Type: Terminal_

Once all the stream processing is done, we can use the `collect()`
with a suitable collector option.
We saw in the previous example how we used collect with toList collector
to collect stream of `double salary` into the `List<Double> salaries`.
The strategy for collection is provided via the `Collector` interface.

#### filter
_Operation Type: Intermediate_

`filter()` as the name suggests, helps filter a given stream. It does so,
by passing the elements of input stream via a Predicate, that
evaluates to either `true / false` based on a condition on the element.
This also means, that `flter()` generates a stream of the same type of elements.

```java
List<Employee> employeesWithSalariesUnder200K = empList.stream()
                .filter(e -> e.getSalary() < 200000)
                .collect(Collectors.toList());
```

#### findFirst
_Operation Type: Terminal_

`findFirst()` returns an Optional for the first entry in the stream; the Optional can, of course, be empty.

```java
Optional<Employee> employee = empList.stream().findFirst();
```

#### toArray
_Operation Type: Terminal_

`collect()` is used to collect the stream into a Collection. If we need to get an array out of the stream, we can simply use `toArray()`.

```java
Employee[] employees = empList.stream().toArray(Employee[]::new);
```

#### flatMap
_Operation Type: Intermediate_

`flatMap()` helps us flatten a complex stream such as below. We have a `List<List<Stream>>>`;
flatMap would help us flatten it to a `Stream<String>` which can be collected into a `List<String>`.
`map()` takes one input, generates one output. `flatMap()` takes one input and generates
zero or more outputs.

```java
List<List<String>> couples = Arrays.asList(
        Arrays.asList("Donald Duck", "Daisy Duck"),
        Arrays.asList("Mickey Mouse", "Minnie Mouse"),
        Arrays.asList("Nobita", "Shizuka"));

List<String> employees = couples.stream()
                .flatMap(Collection::stream)
                .collect(Collectors.toList());
```

#### peek
_Operation Type: Intermediate_

`peek()` is an intermediate operation that helps perform a function
over each element of a stream.

## Method Types and Pipelines

In the last section we saw different stream operations and available methods
to use them. Some methods are terminal(_returns non-stream types_) which marks the stream as consumed
some are intermediate(_returns streams_), output of which can be further processed.

> A stream pipeline consists of a stream source, followed by zero or more intermediate operations,
> and a terminal operation.

**Here's a short example**
Here we are using a `stream()` that is passed to `filter()`, that intern
returns a filtered-stream, which is forwarded to `collect()`. Here, `stream(), filter()`,
are intermediate operations, and `collect()` is a terminal operation.

```java
List<Employee> employeesWithSalariesUnder200K = empList.stream()
                .filter(e -> e.getSalary() < 200000)
                .collect(Collectors.toList());
```

Some operations are called **short-circuiting operations**.
**Short-circuiting** operations allow computations on infinite streams to complete in finite time.
Here, `Stream<T> iterate(final T seed, final UnaryOperator<T> f)` will generate an infinite
stream starting with 0, with next elements incremented by 1 more than current.
the `skip()` short-circuit operation is used to skip the first `n` elements in the input stream.
if `stream().count()` < `n`, then an empty stream is generated. here we skip the first 5 elements.
That gives us a stream of numbers starting from 5, incremented by 1. `limit()` helps to limit the stream up to 10.
i.e. a stream from 5 to 14.

```java
 Stream.iterate(0, n -> n + 1)
    .skip(5)
    .limit(10)
    .forEach(System.out::println);
```

## Lazy Evaluation

One thing that significantly improves Java streams is the ability to evaluate   
operations lazily.
It is not until the terminal operation is triggered, the source data is computed. Consumption happens only as needed.   All intermediate operations are lazy, i.e. not executed until a result of a processing is actually needed.

```java
Employee employee = Stream.of(employees)
  .filter(e -> e != null)
  .filter(e -> e.getSalary() > 100000)
  .findFirst()
  .orElse(null);
```

Here, all the operations are performed on first employee from the array. Since the first employee has salary less than 200000, it proceeds to run the operations on the second object. this object satisfies the first and second `filter()` calls. Hence, the third operation `findFirst()` is evaluated, and Employee object is returned. No operations are performed on the third object.

Lazy Evaluation avoids examination of the data thatâ€™s not necessary. This behaviour becomes even more important when the input stream is infinite and not just very large.

## Comparison Based Stream Operations

#### sorted
`sorted()` sorts the input stream based on the comparator passed inside it.

```java
empList.stream()
      .sorted((e1, e2) -> e1.getSalary() > e2.getSalary())
      .collect(Collectors.toList());
```

Here we sorted the `empList` by the employee salaries.
> **_NOTE:_**  short-circuit operations will not be applied for sorted(). Even if we had used findFirst(), it would have first sorted the array. Because without that, one would not know which would be the first sorted element.

#### min and max
As the name suggests, these are used to get the maximum or minimum element from a stream based on a comparator. The return is wrapped in an Optional since either of these could be absent in the stream.

```java
Employee highestSalariedEmployee = empList.stream()
      .max(Comparator.comparing(Employee::getSalary))
      .orElseThrow(NoSuchElementException::new);

Employee lowestSalariedEmployee = empList.stream()
      .min(Comparator.comparing(Employee::getSalary))
      .orElseThrow(NoSuchElementException::new);
```

#### distinct
Removes duplicates from the input stream by using the `equals()` method of the stream elements to conclude whether two elements are same or not.

```java
Stream.of(1, 3, 5, 2, 2, 8, 3).distinct().collect(Collectors.toList());
```

#### allMatch, anyMatch, and noneMatch

All of these operations take a `Predicate` and return a `boolean`. Short-circuiting is applied and processing is stopped as soon as the answer is determined

```java
boolean allEven = intList.stream().allMatch(i -> i % 2 == 0);
boolean oneEven = intList.stream().anyMatch(i -> i % 2 == 0);
boolean noneMultipleOfThree = intList.stream().noneMatch(i -> i % 3 == 0);
```

`allMatch()`checks if the `Predicate` is `true` for all the elements in the stream. Here, it returns`false`as soon as it encounters 5, which is not divisible by 2.

`anyMatch()`checks if the `Predicate` is `true` for any one element in the stream. Here, again short-circuiting is applied and `true`is returned immediately after the first element.

`noneMatch()`checks if there are no elements matching the `Predicate`. Here, it simply returns `false`as soon as it encounters 6, which is divisible by 3.
